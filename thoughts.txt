General Thoughts:

Objects declared with `type` are value types. They are always allocated on
the stack or within the allocated space of another object. They have the
same semantics as `C` value types in that they are passed by value and are
structurally copied on assignment. They *must* have a copy constructor.
This is required for assigning types to variables and to internal memory
buffers. They may hold reference types as fields, however these references
are subject to garbage collection rules.

Objects declared with `class` are reference types. They are always allocated
on the heap. They have the same semantics as `C` pointers in that they are
passed by reference and assigned by reference. Reference types are subject
to garbage collection. Reference types may hold value types as fields.

`self` is implicit in method bodies. This may seem to violate the rule that
"explicit is better than implicit", but this is less typing for everyone
and the alternative is to have the runtime "implicitly" pass `self` as the
first argument to all methods.

We will have exceptions, but only for exceptional circumstances. We will
avoid using exceptions for control flow.

Objects of `type` and `class` are nominally typed. If code expects a
nominal type, it will only receive that nominal type. "duck-typing" one
type to fit a nominal type is not allowed. Use `protocol` types for
"duck-typing".

A `protocol` type is any object that *structurally* meets the definition of
a `protocol`. Think of this as "explicit" duck-typing, or an interface. This
will necessarily be slower in-use than nominal types, due the boxing and/or
virtualization that may be required. Protocols cannot be "subclassed".

"Dunder" methods are used to support the language syntax and runtime. They
are not visible outside of the runtime. This is compiler-enforced.

"Leading-underscore" names are private to the nominal `type` or `class`.
They are not visible to outside code *or* to sublcasses. Private name
shadowing is allowed in subclasses and the types may be different.

Public name shadowing is allowed in subclasses, but the type signatures
must be consistent throughout the class hierarchy.

There is not concept of "protected" or "friend" like in C++.

At the module level, "Leading-underscore" names are private to the module
and cannot be exported.

Destructors would be nice, but that increases implementation complexity
and doesn't really make sense for GC'd reference types. Modern GC systems
support "finalizers" that could work. But really I want something that
enables something like RAII in C++ for guaranteeing cleanup on function
exit. Maybe we have some sort of "exit" block that is guranteed to be
called on function exit.

`readonly` attributes. Current thoughts are that they are `readonly` by
code which "consumes" the type or class. They can be modified by the
type or class itself, but not by subclasses. `const` attributes are constant
and can never be changed after initialization, by anything. Note that a
`const` attribute can decay to `readonly` to meet a protocol.

Questions:

- The types declared in this file are always available as "magic" builtins.
  They do not need to be imported. Therefore, do we allow shadowing of these
  type names by user code, or not worry about it because these types can
  also be imported explicitly?

- Implicit default constructors?

- Implicit default destructor?

- Syntax for lists, dicts, sets, and their underlying types? I don't like
  the Python `list` API because it is not uniform. We have an opportunity
  to have better APIs for the builtin syntactic types. I'm thinking that
  the syntax should support only fixed-size objects. For example, the
  tuple sytax is a fixed-size allocation. I'm thinking of using the "list"
  syntax to create a mutable-but-fixed-size builtin "array" object, akin
  to a C++ array. Variable size collections would all be libraries that are
  implemented the "standard library", ala "Vector", "Dict", "Set", etc...

- Builtin string type. Will be UTF-8, but Unicode aware?
